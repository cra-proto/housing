	      <p>Eligible rent only includes payments for your qualifying principal residences paid from January 1 to December 31, 2022. Amounts paid before or after 2022 were <strong>not</strong> eligible.</p>
        <h3>Meals, board or other services</h3>
        <p class="mrgn-tp-md">Any payment that was <strong>specified</strong> on the lease for meals, board or other services was not eligible.</p>
        <p class="mrgn-tp-md">If the rent you paid included an amount for meals, board or other services, but the portion of rent that went towards these services was <strong>not</strong> specified on the lease, <strong>only 90%</strong> of the total amount of rent you paid was eligible.</p>
        <h3>Utilities and taxes that were not part of the rental agreement</h3>
        <p>Payments for utilities or property taxes were <strong>not</strong> eligible unless they were <strong>either</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>not part of the rental agreement</li>
          <li>paid to a person or entity who was <strong>not</strong> a party to the lease, licence or arrangement</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Business expense deductions</h3>
        <p>Any payments that were deducted as a business expense were <strong>not</strong> eligible rent amounts.</p>
        <h3>Rent for capital lease type arrangements</h3>
        <p>Any payments of rent to own or other capital lease type arrangements, where all or a portion of the rent went towards the purchase of the property, were <strong>not</strong> eligible rent amounts.</p>
        <h3 id="rent-parent">Rent paid to a parent or another relative</h3>
        <p>If you paid rent to a parent or another relative, this was <strong>only</strong> eligible as rent if the payment was considered by the CRA as <strong>rental income for tax purposes</strong> for the parent or relative who received it.</p>
        <h3>Amounts paid to a landlord by an assistance program</h3>
        <p>Any payments made by a social assistance program or provincial or territorial rental assistance program directly to your landlord on your behalf were <strong>not </strong>eligible rent amounts. <strong>Only</strong> payments that you paid to a landlord as rent were eligible.</p>
